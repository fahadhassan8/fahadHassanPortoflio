    <h1>Kebabs</h1>
    <p><i>Chinese food lovers you can get more delicious food here thamn chinaThe word “kebab” is Turkish for “grilled
            meat.” The most familiar form of kebab for many people is the shish kebab, made with meat which is cut into
            chunks and lightly seasoned before being skewered. Many people also like to add vegetable chunks to their
            shish kebabs, such as onions, peppers, squash, and mushrooms. It is also possible to find kebabs made with
            long strips of meat, along with doner kebabs, made by grinding meat, forming it into a cylinder around a
            skewer, and slow-roasting it. In India, people eat kathi kebab, a form of kebab cooked in a tandoor
            oven.</i></p>
