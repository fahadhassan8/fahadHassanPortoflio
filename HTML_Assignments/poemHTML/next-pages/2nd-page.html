            A single sentence broken up into 8 small lines, <br>
            Anaïs Nin’s “Risk” uses a flower as a metaphor, <br>
            to remind us that there will come a day when the pain of complacency will <br>exceed
            the pain of actually daring to make a
            change. <br>
            The poem serves as an understated call to action — make the change now, <br>
            no matter how scary.
